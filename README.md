# Description

This project is supposed to be a simulation of a program that allows to
scan other machines for viruses and vulnerabilities


**THIS PROGRAM IS A SIMULATION AND DOESN'T REALLY PERFORM AND SECURITY CHECKS**

# How To Use

First of all you need to write the "QuickScanReport.docx" and "FullScanReport.docx" files.
Those are the files that the simulation opens after it's finished.

The files should be in the same directory as the executable.

After the files are in the correct directory you start the program and a scan mode.

**NOTE: To change the location of the files you need to edit the main
file of the source code as the locations and the names are hard-coded.**

# Code Style

- All file names must be in **snake case**.
- All class names must be in **pascal case**.
- All properties/variables must be in **snake case**
- All methods/functions must be in **camel case**
- All constants must be in **screaming snake case**
